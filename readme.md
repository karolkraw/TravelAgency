# TravelAgency




## General Information
TravelAgency is a travel management system that provides various functionalities. Users can create an account and log in to the system. During registration, the user will receive a confirmation email to verify their email address.

Once logged in, users can browse through the available trips offered by the travel agency. The trips may include information such as destination, duration, price, and guide.

Additionally, the system has an administrator account with additional permissions to manage users, tours, and guides. The administrator can view and modify user accounts, create and manage tours, and assign guides to tours.

I created this application to learn thoroughly how REST API works, acquire fundamental knowledge in Spring Security, as well as learning various aspects of Hibernate.
